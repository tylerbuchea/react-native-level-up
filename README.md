👁 AR in Minutes with RN & Expo 👁

Augmented Reality is all the rage right now with Apple releasing ARKit and Google's new ARCore. You can get in on the action too with React Native and Expo!

This stuff is still in early stages so an iOS device is required for this demo.

You can clone and start my repo:
git clone git@github.com:tylerbuchea/ar-expo-cube.git
cd ar-expo-cube
npm install
npm start
Note: If you need to download the Expo viewer app or you don't want to bother setting up the repo I recommend going here:
