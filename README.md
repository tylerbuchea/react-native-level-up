ðŸ˜Ž Fast Prototyping with Expo Snack ðŸ˜Ž

Expo is the technology backing [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) and their Snack service is basically a full fledged React Native development environment in the browser.

It's a free service with killer features like:
  - Drag and drop components
  - Live reload on device or in browser
  - Instant share-ability

Get started by signing up and creating your first "Snack".

Note: If you're worried about lock in don't be! You can always use create-react-native-app to eject into a regular React Native application setup.
